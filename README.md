# Introduction to Python MOOC, University of Helsinki

These are all the exercises that I will be posting on to document my progress on the free open online [course](https://programming-23.mooc.fi) by the University of Helsinki. This is going to be for the introduction part to the program (Python). I will be posting the advanced course material as I progress onto that section as the weeks go by.
